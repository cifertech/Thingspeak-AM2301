# Thingspeak-AM2301
I decided to go one step further and build a multifunctional IoT thermometer with the ability to display temperature and humidity values on the Oled ssd1306 display as well as send data to the thingspeak dashboard. In fact, at the same time as the data is analyzed and the humidity and temperature values are displayed on the OLED display, then these values are sent to the thingspeak cloud servers and the values will be displayed numerically and graphs in relation to time and values.

## What it DO!
In the IoT thermometer project with ThingSpeak IoT platform and AM2301 sensor using three pieces which is oled display to show temperature and humidity values, AM2301 or DHT21 sensor to get ambient temperature and humidity values and esp8266 Wi-Fi range Wemos to send values to Thingspeak servers by connecting to the Internet at home or work so that we can finally display these values in our iot dashboard. There is also this feature for our iot dashboard to be displayed using a special link for the public, which we can use to provide the measured values in each project at different times.

### Items needed
-Wemos
-Am3201 (DHT21)
-Oled 0.96

### Required libraries
-ESP8266WiFi
-DHT

## Conclusion
The IoT thermometer project can be useful in a variety of situations, including in the workplace or at home, so running this tutorial you have a thermometer with the ability to display temperature and humidity graphically, and you can also use temperature changes in the iot platform used That is, see Thingspeak, this project can be introduced as a complete project that only if placed in the right packaging is no different from other smart devices in a house.
